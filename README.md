## Download [![](https://jitpack.io/v/esafirm/android-image-picker.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#esafirm/android-image-picker)

Add this to your project's `build.gradle`

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

And add this to your module's `build.gradle` 

```groovy
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.esafirm.android-image-picker:imagepicker:x.y.z'
	// for experimental rx picker
	implementation 'com.github.esafirm.android-image-picker:rximagepicker:x.y.z'
	// If you have a problem with Glide, please use the same Glide version or simply open an issue
	implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.5.0'
}
```

change `x.y.z` to version in the [release page](https://github.com/esafirm/android-image-picker/releases)

**Breaking changes**

If you're not using custom image loader and have Glide v3 in your classpath, please using version `1.8.0` below! 
Will improve this image loader compatibility issue in ImagePicker v2! 

# Usage

For full example, please refer to the `sample` app. 

Also you can browse the issue labeled as question [here](https://github.com/esafirm/android-image-picker/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Aquestion+)

## Start image picker activity

The simplest way to start 

```java
ImagePicker.create(this) // Activity or Fragment
	    .start();
``` 

Complete features of what you can do with ImagePicker

```java
ImagePicker.create(this)
	.returnMode(ReturnMode.ALL) // set whether pick and / or camera action should return immediate result or not.
	.folderMode(true) // folder mode (false by default)
	.toolbarFolderTitle("Folder") // folder selection title
	.toolbarImageTitle("Tap to select") // image selection title
	.toolbarArrowColor(Color.BLACK) // Toolbar 'up' arrow color
	.includeVideo(true) // Show video on image picker 
	.single() // single mode
	.multi() // multi mode (default mode)
	.limit(10) // max images can be selected (99 by default)
	.showCamera(true) // show camera or not (true by default)
	.imageDirectory("Camera") // directory name for captured image  ("Camera" folder by default)
	.origin(images) // original selected images, used in multi mode
	.exclude(images) // exclude anything that in image.getPath()
	.excludeFiles(files) // same as exclude but using ArrayList<File>
	.theme(R.style.CustomImagePickerTheme) // must inherit ef_BaseTheme. please refer to sample
	.enableLog(false) // disabling log
	.imageLoader(new GrayscaleImageLoder()) // custom image loader, must be serializeable
	.start(); // start image picker activity with request code
```                

If you want to call it outside `Activity` or `Fragment`, you can simply get the `Intent` from the builder

```java
ImagePicker.create(activity).getIntent(context)

```

## Receive result

```java
  @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, final int resultCode, Intent data) {
        if (ImagePicker.shouldHandle(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {
			// Get a list of picked images
			List<Image> images = ImagePicker.getImages(data)
            // or get a single image only
			Image image = ImagePicker.getFirstImageOrNull(data)
        }
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    }
```


## Camera Only

```java
ImagePicker.cameraOnly().start(activity) // Could be Activity, Fragment, Support Fragment 

// You could also get the Intent 
ImagePicker.cameraOnly().getIntent(context)
```

You also still can use the `DefaultCameraModule` but discouraged to do it. 

## Return Mode

There's 4 mode available:

1. `ReturnMode.NONE` -> When image is picked, ImagePickerActivity will not dismissed even in Single Mode

2. `ReturnMode.ALL` -> When image is picked dismiss then deliver result

3. `ReturnMode.CAMERA_ONLY` -> When image is picked with Camera, dismiss then deliver the result

4. `ReturnMode.GALLERY_ONLY` -> Same as CAMERA_ONLY but with Gallery

You can define your selected mode with `setReturnMode()` method. 

## Set Save Location

By default, ImagePicker will try to save the image generated from camera to `Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES` with directory name `"Camera"`. 

You can change the directory name only by using:

```java
ImagePicker.create(activity).imageDiretory(String dirName)
``` 

Or you can change the full path of the save location by using:

```java
ImagePicker.create(activity).imageFullDirectory(String fullPath)
```

## Using Another Image Loader Library 

By default, Image picker is using [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) as its image loader library. 

You can change this by using:

```java
ImagePicker.create(activity).imageLoader(ImageLoader customImageLoader)
```

Next thing you wanna do is excluding Glide library from ImagePicker. You can achieve this with Gradle. Ex: 

```groovy
implementation("com.github.esafirm.android-image-picker:imagepicker:x.y.z") {
    exclude group: 'com.github.bumptech.glide', module: 'glide'
})
```
